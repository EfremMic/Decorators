  <p># Decorator Design Pattern in C#

This repository showcases the Decorator Design Pattern implemented in C#. The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible and clean way to extend the behavior of objects without altering their code.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- `Component` interface: Defines the base component interface that concrete components and decorators will implement.
- `Concrete component` class: Represents the core object to which decorators can be attached.
- `Decorator` class: Serves as the base class for all decorators, implementing the `Component` interface.
- `Concrete decorator` classes: Implement specific behaviors and add functionalities to the core component.
